# Contributing to Fractal Renderer

Thank you for your interest in this project!

If you would like to submit a small feature or improvement, then feel free to open a pull request and we can take it from there.

For larger contributions, please open an issue or add comments to an existing one if relevant.

One of my goals in building this project is to learn the rust programming launguage -- one of the best ways to do that is to get feedback from other rust developers. Feel free to suggest improvements to the existing code, or highlight opportunities for learning.
